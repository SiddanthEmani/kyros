## Subscribe

**[Add to Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=webcal%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FSiddanthEmani%2Fkyros%2Fmain%2Fevents.ics)**
&nbsp;— one tap on Android or desktop. Google Calendar (app or web) opens
straight to the "Subscribe" prompt, already filled in.

Or add the raw feed URL manually:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiddanthEmani/kyros/main/events.ics
```

- **Apple Calendar** &nbsp;`File → New Calendar Subscription` → paste URL
- **Google Calendar / Android** &nbsp;use the one-tap link above, or on
  desktop: `Other calendars → + → From URL` → paste URL. Either way it
  syncs to the Google account, so it shows up in the Android app
  automatically.
- **Outlook / Fantastical / anything else** &nbsp;Add subscription by URL

The feed refreshes four times a day. You'll see the next ~30 days of
hand-rankable AI talks, demos, hackathons, and salons — without the noise
of "AI for Founders Networking Drinks" or "Asian American Voices in Tech"
that Luma's `category=ai` lumps in.

`kyros` (κῦρος): authority, weight, signal over noise.

## How it works

```
Luma discover  ─►  filter  ─►  rank  ─►  cap  ─►  events.ics  ─►  your calendar
   ~1700/day      ~250 left    top 40    every 6h     subscribe once
```

1. **Fetch** — scrapes Luma's server-rendered discover HTML and paginates
   the JSON discover API across SF, San Jose, and global-virtual events
   for the next 30 days. Falls back to a CORS relay when the runner IP
   is blocked.
2. **Filter** — drops events past the horizon, events that don't mention
   AI vocabulary in the title or host calendar (catches the Luma
   `category=ai` leak), events outside SF/SJ, and weekday events that
   start before 5 PM local.
3. **Rank** — scores by host reputation (LangChain, Snorkel, Modal,
   DeepMind, AI Tinkerers, …), technical title vocabulary (RAG, agentic,
   evals, fine-tuning, …), and lightly penalizes purely-social titles.
4. **Cap** — keeps the top N (default 40) and writes a clean `.ics`.

## How to run it yourself

Fork the repo, enable Actions, done. The `kyros-refresh` workflow runs
every 6 hours (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC), regenerates `events.ics`, and
commits it back. Anyone subscribed to your raw URL gets the refresh
automatically.

No secrets, no API keys, no servers — just a `.ics` file in a public
repo. Run locally with `python run.py` if you want to inspect.

## Configuration (`config.json`)

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cities` | `["san-francisco", "san-jose"]` | Luma `city_slug`s to query |
| `include_virtual_global` | `true` | also fetch virtual / global events |
| `lookahead_days` | `30` | drop events past this horizon |
| `min_weekday_hour_local` | `17` | weekday events must start at/after this hour, in `local_tz`. `0` disables |
| `local_tz` | `"America/Los_Angeles"` | IANA tz for the schedule check |
| `max_events_per_run` | `40` | top-N cap after ranking. `0` = unlimited |

## Files

```
run.py                         # the entire job
config.json                    # user-editable
requirements.txt               # icalendar
.github/workflows/refresh.yml  # 6-hourly schedule
events.ics                     # output (committed by CI)
```

## Why this exists

I wanted one calendar I could open on Sunday night and see every meaningful
AI talk in SF for the coming weeks — without scrolling through Luma's
"AI Founders Networking Drinks" or "Asian American Voices in Tech" that
its `category=ai` tag lumps in. The signal-to-noise on the raw discover
feed is brutal, and the events I actually want are spread across 50+
calendars.

`kyros` is the small cron that does that filtering for me, and the public
`.ics` URL means I can subscribe from any device and never think about it
again.
